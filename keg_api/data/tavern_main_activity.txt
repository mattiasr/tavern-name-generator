Everyone is dancing
A great free-for-all brawl is well underway
Everyone seems to be having a good time
Several card games are underway and the tense silence of the games are occasionally interrupted by shouts of victory or cries of dismay
People are enjoying themselves
All, save a few, are enjoying themselves
Most people are having a good time
There are yells for service from the tables
Sales seem to be in a lull at the moment
Seems like most customers are enjoying themselves
Most people are having a good time
Things seem to have calmed down a bit from before
Looks like you caught a meal rush
Most tavern patrons look thirsty
Most people are having a good time
A lone patron is sleeping at a table
Love seems to be in the air tonight, (you notice each and every table seems occupied by couples)
Everyone seems to be keeping to their own business, suspiciously eyeing strangers,
