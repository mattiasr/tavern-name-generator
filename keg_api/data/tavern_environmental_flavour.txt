Rain is patterning off it’s gleaming roof
Playful winds toy with a creaking windvane on top of the structure
Light gleams in slightly stained windows
Mist and fog barely obscure the peak of the roof and you can see the ominous shapes of ravens perching on the roof
Over the door hangs a Red and Gray sign depicting a Gate
Painted next to the door is a Yellow and Black Gate with the words 'Welcome Traveler' underneath
A sign out front shows a Yellow and White Gate with the words 'Bloody Gate Tavern' written in large, black letters
Signs in Purple and Silver depicting a fading Gate point the way to a robust entrance
Over the door hangs a Green and Gray sign depicting a Gate
Light streams out of the windows and you can hear the sound of activity from within
Several of the windows have been smashed, repaired, boardered shut, repaired and smashed again through generations of renovations
A few wooden shingles lay smashed on the street outside, having come loose from wind or, let’s say, second storey activities..
A pen of pigs next plot over is making almost as much noise as the bar
It seems to be the capitol of pidgeon activity in this region. It is covered in white flecks and nesting birds
Several morose horses stand tied to a bar outside
Near the entrance, a massive Dartmoor hound lies snoring (and drooling) on the stairs
Two cats watch you expectantly from high atop the wall separating the yard from the street
The air above the entrance is filled with clotheslines running back and forth from one of the windows
A pair of brasken (cat-size gryphons) are raiding the trash in the side street with much gusto
A sign bearing the Ordermark and the words ‘Under the protection of Wizards’ sits near the door. Not a place to start trouble
The chimney jutting out of the roof spreads the pleasant smell of woodsmoke and food
Two old human men are moving pieces on a game board beneath the overhang of one of the windows
A gaggle of children run screaming with glee out the door, pursued by a small dog
The eyes of a hooded man of indiscernible heritage seems to follow you from across the road as you approach
Two drunk women exit the door, laughing uproariously when they stumble into you, apologizing profusely before continuing on their way while performing the Hymn of Rod Hesca in a duet at the top of their lungs
An angry woman dragging a man by the ear exits the door, followed by three wailing children. She gives you an accusatory stare, as if this was somehow YOUR fault, leading her profusely apologizing husband homeward
A large Frux at the entrance points towards a barrel full of weapons by the door, demanding you leave any weapons bigger than knives out here before entering
