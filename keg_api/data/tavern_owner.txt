just coming out of the kitchen
a rosy human woman in stained, ill-fitting clothing, but sporting the most genuinely happy face youâ€™ve seen in some time
a dour man with a black beard and a long leather apron
a weathered-looking older woman
a young woman missing an eye
a dark-skinned women with a weary smile
a well-dressed young woman in a stained white shirt
a tanned woman in a red vest
a tired-looking older woman
a tall human woman (but is secretly a magical beast in disguise!)
an ordinary-looking human female
a striped, gray Kitkin
