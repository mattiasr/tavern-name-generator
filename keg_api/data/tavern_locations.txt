in a square lined by market stalls
located in a crooked street
in a street off the main road
adjacent to the main road
parallel to the main road
on the main road
on the central street
just off the main road
a bit off the road
just off the market road
at market road
at market square
at the cross of Kingâ€™s road and granary row
at a busy crossroads
at a perfectly perpendicular crossroads
where three roads meet
at a crossroads where five roads terminate
at a meeting of roads frequented by traders and tinkerers
where the main street crosses the Royal highway
at a crossroads, across from a smithy
next to a giant oak tree
next to a small pond
crammed in between two high, fortified buildings
next to a crooked tower
wall-in-wall with a prosperous brothel
next to a large manor
next to a bend in a small river
next to a well maintained field
next to a huge boulder that looks a bit like a Page. Probably where it got its name
high atop a hill
at the end of the road
where the road dips into a low, wide gully
in a steep slope
below a mighty ridge
overlooking a muddy canal
near a natural spring
opposite the chapel of gods
near a rather ugly statue
between a pair of massive tree stumps
next to a lumber supply
wall-in-wall with a granary
in the shadow of a mighty tower
in the busiest street of town
on top of a majestic cliff overlooking the surrounding area
squeezed in between a carpenter and a cobbler
facing across from a competing inn
