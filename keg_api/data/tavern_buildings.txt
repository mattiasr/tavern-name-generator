a four-storey wooden building with a peaked roof, resting on a solid foundation of stone
a three-story brick building, stout and grey, sitting like a toad
a conglomeration of two slightly leaning buildings that seem to have grown together during some long past renovation
two wooden buildings connected by a narrow bridge spanning the road
the ground floor of several generations of towers built close together
a long, low two-story hall, with a circular gabel at one end
a thin, high building set on the base of two old tower foundations, spanning the road like a bridge
a tall seven-story building with a great, peaked roof. Several chimneys sprout from the ridge and dormers dot the roof sides. Like a shrunken castle citadel, it sits in splendour
a regular wooden building, several storeys high, with a tiled roof. A roofed balcony overhangs the entrance
a chaotic jumble of different buildings, all joined together in a haphazard fashion, forming one great pile of architecture
a low brick building that was probably a barn before someone refurbished it
a thin, wooden building squished in between two others
a swollen wooden building perched atop a small stone foundation. It looks like a cat trying to fit in a too small box, only a wooden building
a towering building with several peaked, intersecting roofs and towers, set on what looks like an ancient castle wall foundation
a flat, square pourstone block of a house, ancient and weathered but kept
a building that seems to have had a ship land on top of it. There is evidence of old damage, but during generations of repairs, the hull of the ship has been incorporated with the building, creating a unique piece of architecture
a building shaped like an oblong barrel, with several large chimneys all venting gray smoke
down the stairs, in the basement of an old, fortified storage building
in the stone basement level of a high wooden building
in the basement level of a high wooden building with slanted roofs and shuttered windows
in the foundations of a ruined tower, upon which a wooden roof and scaffolding has been built
a rooftop establishment with great view, open sky and a few mismatched marquises and parasolls to keep the weather off the guests
up a back-alley stair, to the top floor of several buildings, where it sprawls like a maze over the rooftop terraces and patios
the top floor of a large, empty hall. Once, this might have been a barn, but now the building is split between the top level establishment and a questionably successful workshop in the lower levels of the structure. It is set
crammed into the rafters of a large residential building. One enters through a ladder at the top landing of an apartment building
occupying a stone tower
set in the entrance to a sealed off pre-cataclysm dungeon
a converted pre-cataclysm building
holed up in the second story of a large wooden building
a 2nd storey establishment, on top of a furniture store
an establishment in the 2nd storey of a stone and wood building
