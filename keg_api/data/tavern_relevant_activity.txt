leading the band
desperately trying to stop it
cleaning mugs at the bar
cleaning an empty table
mopping the floor between the tables
helping a drunk patron clean up his lost dinner
wiping the tables with a not-too-clean cloth
balancing a few trays of steaming food from the kitchen
polishing glasses at the bar
hammering a tap into a new keg of ale
delivering a set of plates to a table of grateful patrons
serving food at the bar
pouring mugs of ale from a keg behind the bar
getting up from a table of old regulars as you enter
looking bored at the bar
giving you a grim look you don’t feel like you’ve earned. Yet
